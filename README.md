# Hello-World
 "Winter is Coming!"
  "So What do you say to the god of death"
    "Not Today!"
Do not thank me because these are "The things I do for Love."
And "The North Remembers!"
Because "A Lannister always pays his debts"
Also " A Dragon is not a slave."
"Fire cannot kill a dragon" but ice can ;)
So "now his watch has ended"
"Valar Morghulis"
And btw "Hodor?"
